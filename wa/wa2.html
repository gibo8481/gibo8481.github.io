    <p><strong>I am a CTD major with a minor in computer science. </strong></p>
    <p>I am going into my third year of college. Outside of school, I like to snowboard with the CU snowboarding team, create content/images/media for the music & fashion industry, and travel around. </p>
    <p> <em>I am especially a wizard with photography. </em> I have a photo website if you want to check it out:  <a href="https://www.giaboudreau.com/"> giaboudreau.com </a> </p>
    <p> My goal for this course is to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and eventually become <u>proficient</u> enough so I can apply them to my own projects.</p>
